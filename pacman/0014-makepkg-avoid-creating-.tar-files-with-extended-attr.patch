Subject: [PATCH 14/N] makepkg: avoid creating .tar files with extended
 attributes

Extended attributes are not necessary for pacman to work. Extended
attributes may not even be supported by the file system to which we
extract the files.

And worst of all: pacman cannot handle extended attributes, but simply
stops extracting files when it encounters an extended attribute.

This is particularly nasty when creating packages on a system configured
to cache, say, file integrity information about .exe files in extended
attributes, as the created packages will fail to install any .exe files.

The fix is very easy: simply pass the -no-xattrs option to bsdtar.
